# Unity UI View System

This project contains an example of reusable UI Views system.

A lot of stuff here can be refactored and improved. You are welcome to contribute with cleaner code or more examples, etc. Please create a pull request. It would be best if code conventions would follow the same rules but I can modify changes to fit the same style.

Demo scene requires LWRP and Cinemachine to function properly.
